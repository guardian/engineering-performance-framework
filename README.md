# Engineering performance framework

This is the framework we use to assess the performance of engineers every 6
months. Much like the software we write, this framework will never be perfect or finished.

For each role it is split into the same 4 categories:
* üë©‚Äçüë® People
* üöö Delivery
* üí° Innovation
* ‚ú® Initiative & Influence.

Where the progression framework sets out high level expectations for a role, which may not be achievable every quarter,
the performance framework details everyday behaviours:
  - Criteria labeled "Core", we believe, contribute most to the department, and the expectation is that you consistently meet them 
  - Criteria labeled "Growth", we believe, are behaviours which contribute towards you growing and developing within your role

#### Review
Every 6 months, at the end of Q1 and Q3, you and your manager will review your performance over the last 2 quarters using this framework.

During a performance review, each criteria within each category will be assessed as 'met' or 'not-met':

Taking an active role in your performance gives you the best chance of receiving a fair assessment and of getting the most out of your manager as they support your growth.
