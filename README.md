# Engineering performance framework

This is the framework we use to assess the performance of engineers every 6
months.  For each role it is split into the same 4 categories: People,
Delivery, Innovation and Initiative & Influence.  Each category is scored on a
1-3 scale.  The requirements for 2 and 3 are listed explicitly, and a score of
1 indicates not consistently meeting what is required to score 2.

Much like the software we write, this framework will never be perfect or
finished - we should keep improving it as we use it.
